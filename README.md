# NoStamina-SKSE
based on: https://github.com/malus741/NoStaminaConsumptionOutsideCombat  slightly changed + updated for GOG and VR

the changes are only subtle but it helped me a ton to understand how to get started with SKSE plugins

**Changes:**
- Generated ini file to toggle options
- No Magicka Consumption out of combat
- updated for the latest CommonLib-NG to work with the GOG version of the game and thanks to Nightfallstorm it also works with VR

### I'm still in the midst of figuring out how that works, don't expect it to be the best way to do it. 

## Building
```
git clone https://github.com/chri3i/Adjustable-Attribute-Consumption-SKSE
cd Adjustable-Attribute-Consumption-SKSE
cmake --preset skyrim
```
